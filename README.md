 #CSC450 Senior Research - Brian McKenna

The objective of this research is to explore the ways in which Human Computer Interaction (HCI) can be improved using the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This will be done using MySQL, IBM Watson Assistant and various programming skills to connect the technologies and make them usable to achieve common database tasks.

The goal of using these technologies is to simulate syntactical expressions that may be used in common database management work using controlled input from a user that is more similar to natural language than what is usually used to interface with an SQL database system.

#Why use SQL?
SQL is a very rigid syntax-oriented query language. While it may be limited in its capability, it is still widely used in the field of computer science and is a foundation for many business systems. The reason it was chosen for this project is because of the simplicity and consistency of its grammar and structure in utilization, meaning it lends itself to being used as a learning tool for this system.

#There are many interfaces that already work with SQL. Why bother with this?

While there may be many tools available already for users to integrate SQL into their workflow, none utilize the NLP capabilities that this project aims to highlight. Wouldn't it be great if users could simply ask their machine to query data for them, instead of having to understand the very rigid and often complex nesting, cross-table data accessing and complicated data matching techniques?
